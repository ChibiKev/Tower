## Intro To Computing
Project for CSC 103 - Intro To Computing with Professor William Skeith at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
In this project, you are asked to implement a general solution to the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
<br/>
Here are a few things you should learn from this:
- The basics of recursion.
- Basics of the runtime stack, and some of the low-level details of how function calls work.
- A bit about command line arguments, and the standard ways for handling them.
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
